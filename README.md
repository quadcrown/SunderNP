# SunderNP

## FOR TURTLE WOW

https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW

## NEEDS SuperWoW TO FUNCTION PROPERLY

Adds sunder armor count to the right of the nameplate, similar to plate addons in classic wow. 

Works with default blizzard nameplates and pfUI nameplates currently. If you have any other nameplate addons that you would like this to be functional with, please make a request as I am not going to dig for every single nameplate addon used on Turtle WoW

## Known issues
- Currently does not work unless pfUI is enabled. Will work on adapting this to an environment that does not rely on pfUI. However, at the moment, this is depedent on it's debuff library and other behavior for detecting mob debuffs without directly targeting the mob. I will credit shagu for his work after this is completed and implemented.
