# SunderNP

## FOR TURTLE WOW
## NEEDS SuperWoW TO FUNCTION PROPERLY

Adds sunder armor count to the right of the nameplate, similar to plate addons in classic wow. 

Works with default blizzard nameplates and pfUI nameplates currently. If you have any other nameplate addons that you would like this to be functional with, please make a request as I am not going to dig for every single nameplate addon used on Turtle WoW
