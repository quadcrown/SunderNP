## NEEDS SuperWoW TO FUNCTION PROPERLY

Adds sunder armor count to the right of the nameplate, similar to plate addons in classic wow. If you do not use SuperWoW, then it will display sunder stacks for the current target on every nameplate that is currently on your screen, sort of making this useless. SuperWoW allows us to recognize that each mob has their own debuffs using GUIDs.

Works with default blizzard nameplates and pfUI nameplates currently. If you have any other nameplate addons that you would like this to be functional with, please make a request as I am not going to dig for every single nameplate addon used on Turtle WoW

## Hotfix 1/09/25
- Removed pfUI dependence by using GUIDs without pfUI
- Performance enhancements
- Credit to Shagu for providing me guidance for these changes! I am but a novice at making addons and working with lua, and I could have not made this addon without him and those who also have contributed to our Turtle WoW community.
